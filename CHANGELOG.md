### v0.3 [20200225]
&emsp;\~  Adapt the script to the new twitter layout. If I did it the lazy way the first time, I wouldn't have had to. Ah well.  
&emsp;\~  Add mode arg to prod build command so webpack stops complaining.  
&emsp;\~  Change how I bind the router, as I learn more about JS inheritance and the prototype model.  
&emsp;\*  Removed a console.log I forgot  
&emsp;\*  Fix a keybind issue for the downloader due to bad a type.  

### v0.2 [20200213]
&emsp;\+  Added auto-redirect from `/i/web` pages to user pages (since the url contains so much data we want - easiest option; this might change later).  
&emsp;\*  Fix a bunch of bugs surrounding how it finds the date on the page.  
&emsp;\*  Fixed a bug with parsing the URL.  
&emsp;\~  Added include for mobile twitter.  

### v0.1.1 [20200212]
&emsp;\*  Forgot to handle multiple images per post. Oops.  
&emsp;\+  Improved handling of message passed to media pages (now they no longer forget if their parent doesn't exist anymore)  

### v0.1 Initial version [20200211]
&emsp;\+ First release. See readme.
