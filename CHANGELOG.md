### v0.2 [20200213]
&emsp;\+  Added auto-redirect from `/i/web` pages to user pages (since the url contains so much data we want - easiest option; this might change later).

&emsp;\*  Fixed a bug with parsing the URL.  
&emsp;\~  Added include for mobile twitter.  

### v0.1.1 [20200212]

### v0.1 Initial version [20200211]
